# Hand-Tracking-and-Gesture-Recognition-Technology-and-Controller-Utilization-in-3D-Space-using-OpenCV
This project implements a hand tracking and gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Pygame. The primary goal is to enable control and interaction in 3D space through hand gestures captured via a webcam.
